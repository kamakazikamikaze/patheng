# Pathway Engineering's Python Toolkit

## The key to awesome automation

The `patheng` package is a collection of modules and functions that many of our scripts use. Rather than copy-paste blocks of code in each script that have to be manually updated when blowing the dust off of them, they are instead centralized and updated in one location to keep everything unified. Spaghetti code and monkey-patches are no longer allowed in this environment: structure is mandatory and maintainability is an absolute must!

## What does/will this contain?

* ElasticSearch handlers
  * Setting up indices
  * Bulk-pushes to clusters
  * Offloading when clusters aren't reachable
* General utilities
  * Reading in configuration files and minimum field requirements
  * Ping-checks if hosts are alive
  * Simple line-by-line loading of file to a list


### To-Do

* General utilities
